## Symbian Anna-style big digital clock screensaver for Nokia Belle. ##

In Nokia Belle the digital clock screensaver got a new look. This screensaver looks very similar to the default screensaver that we used to have in Symbian Anna before upgrading to Belle.
Additionally it has some improvements. Ideas borrowed from the [Sleeping Screen](http://betalabs.nokia.com/apps/nokia-sleeping-screen).

### Features ###
  * Displays time and date information
  * Displays missed calls and new SMS
Additional features:
  * Preserves screen orientation (optional since 1.2)
  * Turns the screensaver off while phone is in a pocket or a bag to save power (please note that it takes up to a minute before the screen is off)
  * Clock moves from top to bottom within a day to avoid pixel degradation.

### Target devices ###
The screensaver only makes sense for devices with an AMOLED display:
  * Nokia C7-00
  * Nokia C6-01
  * Nokia 700
  * Nokia N8
  * Nokia X7
  * Nokia E7
  * Nokia 808

## Installation ##
It is recommended to install to drive C:

After installing the screensaver, go to 'Settings'->'Themes'->'Screen saver' on your phone. In the list select the "Anna screensaver+".

## Troubleshooting ##
  1. If the screensaver is not displayed: make sure you don't have the power saving mode enables. Screensavers don't work in power saving mode.
  1. If digits appear solid, or not like on the screenshot: revert the system font. Screensaver uses standard font for digits. If the system font is modified - the clock would look differently.

## Known Issues ##
  1. The display-off feature doesn't work on some phones. Fixed in 1.1
  1. Clock is not properly scaled for 3.2 and 4.0 inch displays. Fixed in 1.2
  1. Display blinks when screensaver stats. Fixed in 1.2
